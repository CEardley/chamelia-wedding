# The Details

<p class="subtitle">as with most great theatre, this is a two-act production - however, unlike most great theatre, act-one has reduced capacity x</p>

## Part One

**Ceremony**

We are having a teeny tiny two witness ceremony (shout out Amy and Maria) at [**Islington Town Hall**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tJJB9cKidvHA6exb6) at 11:15am.

Whilst you can't join us in the ceremony, we would love for you to wait for us outside (and speculate whether we are
indeed getting married), and throw flowers at us as we leave the building.

**Lunch**

We shall stomp together to [**Salut!**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iM8zpTtBmvk2sXpT6) for lunch, which we can only assume will be delicious.

Please join us upstairs at [**The Alpaca**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uNuehWuNhdjxHvf6A) from 6pm til late. Think pints, sharing platters, naff playlist, potentially a speech or two.
