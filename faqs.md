*"Look chic" - Charles Eardley, 2025*

In reality, please wear whatever you're most comfortable in. Amelia is wearing red. Let loose kids.

<p class="question"><strong>What will I eat?</strong></p>

For those joining us as at lunch, we'll be eating something delicious at [Salut!](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iM8zpTtBmvk2sXpT6).

Everyone else, we encourage you to also have a delicious lunch before joining us at the pub. For local places to eat, check out [our pins on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/88zZPKXioPRSf4NL9) (other establishments are available).

At [The Alpaca](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uNuehWuNhdjxHvf6A) we'll be ordering a selection of sharing plates. There'll also be the option to order any additional food as your bellies desire.

Please let us know of any dietary requirements via the [RSVP form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMye-Fje8Vo_DgDTIamM62md0CbGNa_aCIcAmyneL2X45xvQ/viewform?usp=dialog).

<p class="question"><strong>What will your surnames be?</strong></p>

We'll be following the ancient tradition of combining surnames. We will be taking the first half of Oakley and the second half of Eardley to make Oakley.

<p class="question"><strong>A gift???</strong></p>

We do genuinely honestly mean it - there really is no need! But if you must, please donate to [this pot](https://monzo.me/charleseardley?h=Dk8hv4).
We'll give half of anything to our chosen charities [The RNLI](https://rnli.org/) and [Gendered Intelligence](https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/), and we'll buy a nice bottle of wine with the remainder on our silly little Italian road trip/honeymoon.

(PS, this is just my bank account so please add a note so we know who to say thank you to!).
