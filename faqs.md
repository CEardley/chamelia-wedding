<p class="subtitle">aka, never before asked questions</p>

<div class="faq" markdown="1">
<p class="question"><strong>What should I wear?</strong></p>

*"Look chic" - Charles Eardley, 2025*

In reality, please wear whatever you're most comfortable in. Amelia is wearing red. Let loose kids.

<p class="question"><strong>What will I eat?</strong></p>

Part one attendees, we'll reach out to you for dietaries.

Part two folks, we recommend you also have a delicious lunch before joining us at the pub. For local places to eat, check out [our pins on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/88zZPKXioPRSf4NL9) (other establishments are available).

At The Alpaca we'll be ordering a selection of sharing plates. There'll also be the option to order any additional food as your bellies desire.

<p class="question"><strong>What will your surnames be?</strong></p>

We'll be following the ancient tradition of combining surnames. We will be taking the first half of Oakley and the second half of Eardley to make Oakley.

<p class="question"><strong>A gift???</strong></p>

We really do genuinely honestly mean it - there really is no need! If you really would like to do something, please donate to [this pot](https://monzo.me/charleseardley?h=Dk8hv4).
We will use half for a silly little Italian road trip/honeymoon, and half will go to our chosen charities of [The RNLI](https://rnli.org/), and [Gendered Intelligence](https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/)

(PS, this is just my bank account so please add a note so we know who to say thank you to!).
