<div class="faq">

  <p class="question"><strong>What should I wear?</strong></p>

  <p><em>“Look chic” - Charles Eardley, 2025</em></p>

  <p>In reality, please wear whatever you’re most comfortable in. Amelia is wearing red. Let loose kids.</p>

<div class="faq">

  <p class="question"><strong>What will I eat?</strong></p>

  <p>Part one attendees, we’ll reach out to you for dietaries.</p>

  <p>Part two folks, we recommend you also have a delicious lunch before joining us at the pub. For local places to eat, check out <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/88zZPKXioPRSf4NL9">our pins on Google Maps</a> (other establishments are available).</p>

  <p>At The Alpaca we’ll be ordering a selection of sharing plates. There’ll also be the option to order any additional food as your bellies desire.</p>

<div class="faq">

  <p class="question"><strong>What will your surnames be?</strong></p>

  <p>We’ll be following the ancient tradition of combining surnames. We will be taking the first half of Oakley and the second half of Eardley to make Oakley.</p>

  <p class="question"><strong>A gift???</strong></p>

  <p>We really do genuinely honestly mean it - there really is no need! If you really would like to do something, please donate to <a href="https://monzo.me/charleseardley?h=Dk8hv4">this pot</a>. 
We will use half for a silly little Italian roadtrip/honeymoon, and half will go to our chosen charities of <a href="https://rnli.org/">The RNLI</a>, and <a href="https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/">Gendered Intelligence</a></p>

  <p>(PS, this is just my bank account so please add a note so we know who to say thank you to!).</p>
